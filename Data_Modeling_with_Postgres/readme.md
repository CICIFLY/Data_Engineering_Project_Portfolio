# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way 
to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on
the songs in their app.They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play 
analysis. 

## Project Description
To complete the project:
* Define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus
* Write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Softwares:
* Postgres
* Python ( Jupyter notebook)
